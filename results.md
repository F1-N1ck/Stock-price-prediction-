# üìä Results: Stock Price Prediction Project

This document summarizes the results obtained using two approaches for predicting stock prices:

---

## ‚úÖ ARIMA Model

- Forecast period: 100 days.
- The ARIMA forecast shows a **smooth, slightly slanted line**, reflecting the most recent trend in historical data.
- ARIMA is a linear time series model and does not capture sudden jumps or volatility.
- Best used for short-term, gradual trend forecasting when data is stationary and predictable.

### üî¨ Observations

- The forecast line starts exactly where historical data ends.
- The line may appear nearly flat or gently sloped, which is expected behavior for ARIMA on stock data.

---

## ‚úÖ LSTM Model

- Trained on ~80% of historical data, tested on remaining 20%.
- Uses 60-day sequences (time steps) to predict the next day‚Äôs price.
- LSTM captures non-linear and more complex sequential patterns compared to ARIMA.
- Predictions for both training and test periods plotted alongside actual prices.

### üî¨ Observations

- LSTM predictions track general trends but may smooth out rapid spikes or dips.
- Test predictions align well with actual prices, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize.

## ‚≠ê Conclusion

| Model | Strengths                        | Limitations                                |
|----------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ARIMA    | Simple, interpretable, quick  | Assumes linear trends, cannot capture sharp changes |
| LSTM     | Captures complex, non-linear patterns | Needs more data, harder to interpret       |

- **ARIMA** is useful for rough short-term forecasts when interpretability is needed.
- **LSTM** is powerful for capturing nuanced price movements and learning sequential dependencies, making it a better choice for dynamic financial data.
